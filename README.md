Torrent automatization program who opens multi torrent pages (Little summer vacation's day utility)
I'm gaining 15 seconds aprox. while opening both pages and doing the search, plus the automation itself and the torrent search history.

Some cool modifications:
- Compare the sites SE and opening the download page for the best one. [Done the "opening page" part, comparission still missing]
- Starting the torrent program.
- Using specific sites for specific type of content (1337 and pirate for movies/series, others for software for example).
