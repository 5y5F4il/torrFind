Torrent download automatization program, shows the two best results from two verified torrent sites and opens the default bittorrent software to start the download.
I'm gaining easily 45 seconds aprox. while opening both pages and doing the search, plus the automation itself (I download a lot of files) and the torrent search history is handy.

Some cool modifications:
- Compare the sites SE and opening the download page for the best one. [Done the "opening page" part, COMPARISON STILL MISSING]
- Starting the torrent program. [Now opens the magnet link with your default program, I will mark this item as check]
- Using specific sites for specific type of content (1337 and pirate for movies/series, others for software for example).
